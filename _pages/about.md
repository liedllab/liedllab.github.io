This webpage hosts content for some of our GitHub repositories, most notably the latest version of the [GIST Tutorial](/gist/).

Our repositories 
======
- [liedllab.github.io](https://github.com/liedllab/liedllab.github.io)
	> Contains the code to host and render this website.
	
For the post-analysis of molecular dynamic (MD) simulations of biomolecules:
---------------
- [X-Entropy](https://github.com/liedllab/X-Entropy)
	> Python 3 package to calculate entropy using a KDE with automatic bandwidth prediction. 
	> Primarily used to calculate the dihedral entropy of sidechain movements in biomolecular MD simulations, but applicable to any data.  
	> Cite [Kraml, Johannes, et al. "X-Entropy: A parallelized kernel density estimator with automated bandwidth selection to calculate entropy." Journal of chemical information and modeling 61.4 (2021): 1533-1538.](https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jcim.0c01375)
- [GetContacts_analysis](https://github.com/liedllab/GetContacts_analysis)
	> Python 3 package to easily analyse and visualise the output of the get_contacts tool.  
	> Cite [Fernández-Quintero, Monica L., et al. "The influence of antibody humanization on shark variable domain (VNAR) binding site ensembles." Frontiers in Immunology 13 (2022): 953917.](https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2022.953917).
- [OCD (Orientation of cylindrical domains)](https://github.com/liedllab/OCD)
	> Python 3 script to analyse the orientation of biomolecule dimers during an MD simulation by inscribing a coordinate system based on each monomers moment of inertia.  
	> Cite [Hoerschinger, Valentin J., et al. "OCD. py-Characterizing immunoglobulin inter-domain orientations." bioRxiv (2021): 2021-03.](https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.03.15.435379)

For the analysis of biomolecule structures:
---------------
- [surface_analyses / PEP-Patch](https://github.com/liedllab/surface_analyses)
	> Python 3 toolbox to calculate surface patches from biomolecule structures, either for hydrophobic or electrostatic surface properties.
	> Also contains a variety of other surface hydrophobicity related tool implementations.  
	> Cite [Hoerschinger, Valentin J., et al. "PEP-patch: electrostatics in protein–protein recognition, specificity, and antibody developability." Journal of Chemical Information and Modeling 63.22 (2023): 6964-6971.](https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jcim.3c01490)
- [TopModel]()
	> Python 3 tool to inspect of structural issues in biomolecular structure, e.g. to assess ML modelling outputs.  
	> Cite [Fernández-Quintero, Monica L., et al. "Challenges in antibody structure prediction." MAbs. Vol. 15. No. 1. Taylor & Francis, 2023.](https://doi.org/10.1080/19420862.2023.2175319)

For Grid Inhomogeneous Solvation Theory:
---------------
- [gist_tutorial](https://github.com/liedllab/gist-tutorial)
	> Recent tutorial on how to run GIST calculations, which is an MD-based analysis of spatially resolved solvation enthalpy and solvation entropy.
	> A pdf of the tutorial is available [here](/gist/), while the scripts and files are found in the [repository](https://github.com/liedllab/gist-tutorial).  
	> Currently in review.
- [gisttools](https://github.com/liedllab/gisttools)
	> Python 3 toolkit to work with grid data as generated by GIST, including various post-analysis methods useful for working with GIST data.
- [second_disorder](https://github.com/liedllab/second-disorder)
	> Python 3 implementation of 1st- and 2nd- order entropies for GIST, especially useful to calculate entropies for co-solvents like ions.  
	> Cite [Waibl, Franz, et al. "Explicit solvation thermodynamics in ionic solution: extending grid inhomogeneous solvation theory to solvation free energy of salt–water mixtures." Journal of Computer-Aided Molecular Design (2022): 1-16.](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10822-021-00429-y)
- [md-setup-gist-cross-solvation](https://github.com/liedllab/md-setup-gist-cross-solvation)
	> SI data (setup files) for [Waibl, Franz, et al. "Grid inhomogeneous solvation theory for cross-solvation in rigid solvents." The Journal of Chemical Physics 156.20 (2022).](https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0087549)
- [gigist](https://github.com/liedllab/gigist)
	> C++ / CUDA implementation of GIST on  Nvidia GPUs in ambertools' [cpptraj](https://github.com/Amber-MD/cpptraj). Now obsolete, since it was included in the cpptraj code base.  
	> Cite [Kraml, Johannes, et al. "Solvation free energy as a measure of hydrophobicity: application to serine protease binding interfaces." Journal of chemical theory and computation 15.11 (2019): 5872-5882.](https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jctc.9b00742)
